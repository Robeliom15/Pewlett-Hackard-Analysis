# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to find the number of retiring employees per title and find out who is eligible for the mentorship program. This is due to the massive increase of workers reaching retirement age. The information gained will show us how to fix the coming shortage of workers and the need to train new trainees.

### Summary

-	There is a total of 1940 retires available for the mentorship program

-	A total of 90,398 employees are at retirement age

-	From looking at the titles we can see that 50.2% make up engineers, 44.8% make up staff, and the last 5% make up the manager and technique leader

-	Only 2% of employees at retirement age qualify for the mentorship program

## Summary

In the future, the company can expect 90,398 employees to retire and leave a lot of important engineers and staffing jobs empty. To fill them the company will need a lot of retirees to join the mentorship program. Unfortunately, only 1940 will be available to train new hires which will leave a lot of positions open.
